compilation unit

```ps1

javac <filename>.java # Compile

javap <filename>.class 
javap -p -c <filename>.class 

```

signature of a function is returning and argument types of function

I need to learn `static` in java and `System`

What is difference between `console()` and `in\out`

Console is keyboard and screen

Function-level, class-level scope, loop-body scope

- Stronger data type wins
