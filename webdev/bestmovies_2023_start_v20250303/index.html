            <p><q>Although for some people cinema means something superficial and glamorous, it is something else.<br>
I think it is the mirror of the world.</q><br>

            <p>I love movies about the Internet. As someone who has grown up just as much on the web as off it, I feel as if itâ€™s my virtual home, and inherently connect to films with social networks or hacking or viral media as major plot points perhaps more than films about any other subject.These movies thematically explore different aspects of the web, revealing both the positive and negative affects of living in such a connected world.</p>
            <p><strong>Please be aware that</strong> my list is <em>strongly subjective</em></p>

            <aside></aside>
           <p>Harvard student <b>Mark Zuckerberg</b> creates the <b>social networking</b> site that would become known as <b>Facebook</b>, but is later sued by two brothers who claimed he stole their idea, and the co-founder who was later squeezed out of the business.</p>
        <p><i>The Social Network" is a great film not because of its dazzling style or visual cleverness, but because it is splendidly well-made. Despite the baffling complications of computer programming, web strategy and big finance, Aaron Sorkin's screenplay makes it all clear, and we don't follow the story so much as get dragged along behind it.</i></p>
